# How do I use Atlantis?
By adding Atlantis to your server it is enabled automatically. 
All you need to do is use the OwO bot and you'll get reminded of when the cooldowns expire.

## Want to disable the reminder for a command?
You can do just that. By running the help command `a!help` you can see all the commands in the bot. 

* If you are a admin of the server you will have extra commands to be able to control other features the bot has to offer!
